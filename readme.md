## Financial Fraud Analysis using Machine Learning
Detect fraudulent online transactions using different Machine Learning models, compare performances and come up with the best model that the investors(Banks) can invest on in order to predict fraudulent transactions and maintain the client's transaction secured and confidential.

In this project, we aim to explore three Machine Learning models training the dataset on 80% and testing on 20% to detect fraudulent transactions comparing three models performance and results. 

Please note that this approach can be transferred to other detection analysis in alternative domains. The feature extraction process remains similar and can be replicated on many other detection issues.

## Summary of Findings
Three machine learning algorithms were used to train and test the dataset and were evaluated using different metrics for best performance. The best performance is achieved using random undersampling technique since the available dataset is unbalanced.
